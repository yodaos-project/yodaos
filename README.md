This is a modern operating system for next generation interactive device, and it embraces Web community,
uses JavaScript as the application language.

## Architecture

The project is a group of sub projects open sourced which are:

**Framework**

- [yodaos-project/yodart][]: the JavaScript/Web layer for the OS, it provides the application development model.
- [ShadowNode][]: the [Node.js][] runtime that implements most of core APIs and N-API-compatible.

**Core**

- [flora][]: the IPC library for [YodaOS][]

**Service**

- [yoda-speech-service][]: the speech service that talks to [Rokid][] ASR/NLP cloud.
- [yoda-flora-dispatcher][]: the IPC centered service.

## Releases

This section describes how do [YODAOS][] release and its lifecycle.

#### versions

[YODAOS][] uses [Semver 2.0][] for versioning management, and we have lifecycles for `major` and `minor`.

- `major`: one release per 6 month, and all releases are stable.
- `minor`: one release per 1 month, and only the even ones are __stable__, namely `1.0.x`, `1.2.x`, `1.4.x`.

We assume the 3rd Thursday at every month as [YodaOS][] release date.

#### release requirements

Every release must contain the following parts:

- Repo manifest commit with specific version, for downloading the source code.
- Multiple platform images, includes:
  - Rokid Kamino18 soc.
  - AmLogic A113.
- Changelog describes what changes this updated.

#### stable and pre-versions

Stable version requires the complete tests on:

- Compatibility test suite
- Unit tests of modules and services
- Functional tests
- Integration tests

The above workload is in usual 2 weeks for the team, therefore we introduce pre-version, namely release
candidates(RC) to track the stable releasing progress.

For stable version, we preserve 2 weeks at least to take the workload of full tests, and create a pre-version 
branch `v1.2.x-rc`. Once all the full tests are passed, then create a stable branch(`v1.2.x`) from release
candidate branch(`v1.2.x-rc`).
